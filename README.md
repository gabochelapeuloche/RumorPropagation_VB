# RumorPropagation_VB
Single view app that run a simulation of propagation


This project was a homework assignment, 
the instruction asked to make an application that simulated a behavior such as rumor propagation, 
starting from a very simple model i made, I built this application from scratch.

The validity of the model might be debate, it render a gauss function if the globals parameters for the population are set to their initial value

There's two mode of simulation, all randomize, or you can set a certain number of initials believers that may spraid the rumor to others. The level of
belief is showed by color (from red to green red = convinced green = skeptical).
clcik on "génére" to create the world and the humans, the use start/stop. Every change of initial stettings like number of people etc needs to be follow by a generation. Certain settings can change during the simulation.

The code is partially commented but in French the app is in french to.

(Windows Form app Visual Basic).
